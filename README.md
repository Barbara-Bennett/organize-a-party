# Program to organize a party

Develop a program that conducts a poll for a group of friends who want to have a holiday party. An unspecified group of people can participate in the poll by entering their name and choosing:
• Day: 'S' (Saturday) or 'D' (Sunday)
• The place: 'B' (beach) or 'C' (club)
• Type of food: 'B' (barbecue) or 'S' (snack)
At the end, your program should display the options with the most votes and who voted for the winning options.
